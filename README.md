# HarvardX PH125.9x - Data Science: Capstone

We explored the [WordBank open database](http://wordbank.stanford.edu/) of children's vocabulary development and growth. The database contains data from 75,000+ kids from 25+ languages. We used machine learning algorithms (i.e., regression trees, random forests, linear regressions) to investigate potential relationships between demographic/linguistic variables (our predictors) and vocabulary growth, as measured by productive vocabulary (our outcome measure) on the [The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories](http://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/). All our analyses are exploratory in nature and we donâ€™t have any hypotheses or predictions on what we might find. We will start curating our dataset, moving to descriptive analyses and visualizations, and finally to the machine learning algorithms.
